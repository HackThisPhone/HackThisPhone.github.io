# Hack This Phone

## About
Are you tired of living in a dystopian hellscape populated by multi-billion dollar corporations that see you as nothing more than a resource to be drained and discarded? Me too.

Smartphones have become one of the most ubiquitous tools of the 21st century, nearly everyone has one, but while you might own your device, the companies charging you thousands of dollars for your new phone are also quietly lobbying congress demanding that you be forced to pay insane prices to get your devices repaired or serviced. Worse yet, these smartphone vendors lock you into propriety android and ios operating systems which run proprietary software that [often spies on you!](https://newatlas.com/computers/facebook-not-secretly-listening-conversations/).

If it's only to make your experience better, who cares right? Well, that is until you realize that most smartphones will -by default- upload all pictures taken by them to "the cloud", that is Google or Apple which are scanned by automated systems for possible law violations. Well, if you have nothing to hide, right? [Google would never deactivate and report them to the police completely destroying their digital identity based on a flawed system](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html), would they? 

What these companies are doing is akin to wiretapping the entire world, and if you are here, then you probably want to remove that wiretap. That's what I am offering you because I am tired of this big-tech bullshit too. Right to repair is a great idea, but it does not go far enough. We need completely open-source, open-hardware devices without any ridiculous, devious nonsense added.

## 0x0A

What better way to launch a new line of phones than with the 0x0A, the flagship smartphone. (For those less code-inclined, 0x0A is the ASCII code for newline). Like a newline in a terminal, this phone represents the beginning of something great. [Check it out!](https://github.com/HackThisPhone/0x0A)
